Hey, I am Ritisha, all the way from Nepal to fulfill my childhood dream of studying in the United States. I am doing my major in Computer Science at BYU. My journey has been full of learning, from adapting to a new country, balancing school and work, focusing on my health, and working toward big goals like internships and future travel. Each step has taught me resilience, faith, and the importance of growing a little every single day.
